# Tweeter

A Twitter clone using TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Sanity CMS and NextAuth.

Users can sign in with Google, post tweets and leave comments, and it has a responsive design which closely mirrors the real thing.

I used this as an exercise to improve my fluency with TypeScript and Tailwind design so there are a number of features I didn't attempt, such as following/unfollowing other users and liking/unliking posts, which I have previously implemented in projects such as [Bookface](https://github.com/jonnyabrams/bookface) and [Twitstagram](https://github.com/jonnyabrams/twitstagram).
